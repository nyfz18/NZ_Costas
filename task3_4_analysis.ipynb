    "In our membrane potential plot `v_report` above, the extracellular spike waveform stimulation exhibits a pattern of irregular action potentials. This could be because the electric field applied externally interacts with various regions of the neuron's membrane. Unlike direct current injections that specifically targets the soma, extracellular stimulation can influence multiple parts of the neuron (ex: axon, dendrites) at once. This could generate spikes at different initiation sites and result in irregular, variable spike timing, amplitude, and interspike intervals. \n",

    "In our calcium concentration report `cai_report` above, the calcium concentration is irregular and doesn't have a specific pattern. However, it matches the erratic spiking of the membrane potential. When the membrane potential spikes upwards and depolarizes, calcium channels open which results in a higher calcium concentration in the neuron. We can see a gradual rise over time in the calcium concentration. The bumps are jumps in the calcium in response to the spikings.   \n"
