Selected cell model: neuronal model `626170421` from allen SDK database. 

`my_sim` directory and `sim.ipynb` simulates various intracellular current injections on model 626170421. Currents tested are as follows: 40 pA, 70 pA, 80 pA, 90 pA, 120 pA. Membrane potential and calcium concentration were recorded and graphed. 

`task2_analysis.ipynb` analyzes the graphs that were gathered from the experimentation of the first simulation (`my_sim`)

`my_sim02` directory and `sim2.ipynb` simulates and generates an extracellular spike waveform data set. The input for the external stimuli were provided from `neuropixel_electrode_1um.csv`. Membrane potential and calcium concentration were recorded and graphed.

`task3_analysis.ipynb` analyzes the graphs and data that were gathered from the experimentation of the second simulation (`my_sim02`)
