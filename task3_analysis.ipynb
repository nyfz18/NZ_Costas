    "In our membrane potential plot `v_report` above, the extracellular spike waveform stimulation exhibits a pattern of irregular action potentials. This could be because the electric field applied externally interacts with various regions of the neuron's membrane. Unlike direct current injections that specifically targets the soma, extracellular stimulation can influence multiple parts of the neuron (ex: axon, dendrites) at once. This could generate spikes at different initiation sites and result in irregular, variable spike timing, amplitude, and interspike intervals. \n",
